# Week 6:  Go Language (Recreating Battle Sim) (COMPLETE!)

As part of a hackathon, Josh Davies and I created a webapp that simulated a D&D battle.
(See Week 4) - This week was spent learning more about GoLang by recreating the
battle simulator backend code using Go to see the difference.

CONCLUSION:  This experiment into Golang has not gone the way I expected.  Go does
not seem well suited for the type of object/class-based code needed to recreate the
Battle Simulator.
