# Week 28:  Intermediate Functional Programming Concepts (COMPLETE!)

This week I will be exploring further into Functional Programming -
now that I know the basics, I am going to explore a bit into some of the
more advanced topics in Functional Programming.

I plan to use "Professor Frisby" - a well known online FP teacher.  He has a
[Book](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/) that I
will be using to learn.
