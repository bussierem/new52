# Week 27:  Python Data Science Intro (COMPLETE!)

This week I will be learning more about the basics of data science, namely several useful
libraries and concepts that I can use as intros to the subject in Python.

I will start by following the tutorial located [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markov-chains-python-tutorial) for "Markov Chains".

Then I will learn more about Pandas from [this tutorial](https://www.pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html).
* Note:   This took _way_ longer than 10 minutes to do...

Finally I will learn about Scrapy using [this tutorial](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html).
