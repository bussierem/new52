# Week 17:  Docket (COMPLETE)

This week will be spent learning about Docker, working through the "Docker in Action"
tutorials and learning the basics of containerization

The week was spent reading about and following the tutorials in the "Docker in Action"
book - the book was decent at teaching, but I would have to do more investigation
outside of the textbook, and more hands-on activity.  This is also a difficult subject
to come up with a "project" for.
