# Week 24:  AWS Associate Developer Certification (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent starting the Udemy Course for AWS Associate Developer Certification,
located at http://udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate/

This will be one of the few projects continued past a single week, as it will be continued
so I can get my AWS Certification by taking the certification test.  I will continue
other projects in the meantime, _after_ this week.

During this week I got through many lectures, but only got maybe 1/2 or 1/3 done with the AWS
course on Udemy - I will be continuing the lectures, AND taking the notes in this repository, but
will move on to other projects next week.
