# Week 23:  Cypress Testing Framework (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning the "Cypress" testing framework - a web ui automation
framework that acts as an alternative to Selenium/WebDriverIO.

Overall this was a _fantastic_ project to look into - I replicated a feature file we
use at my current employer, in order to test the feasibility of it.  If it weren't
for the fact that it only supports chromium-based browsers currently, I would be jumping
on it immediately.  Regardless, this will remain a major tool in my testing toolbelt for
future projects.
