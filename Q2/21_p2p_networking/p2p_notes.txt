P2P networks consist only of other computers
  They act as both clients and servers simultaneously
  They connect to each other, without any central server

ARCHITECTURE
  Exist as a "virtual overlay network"
    making logical connections to each other over normal networks
      -This is very similar to SDN!
  Types:
    Structured
      -Structured networks manage the overlay network into a specific topology to
      help with searching, organization, etc.
      PROS:
        Searching for a specific resource is made extremely easy due to knowing where information is kept
      CONS:
        High rate of churn is difficult, since nodes must maintain a list of their neighbors
    Unstructured
      -Unstructured networks have no central organization tying them together,
      with new nodes added based on their relative location to each other.
      PROS:
        Lack of structure allows for local optimization
        These networks do well in the face of high turnover rate of nodes
      CONS:
        Must flood the network to request data from nearby nodes
        No guarantee that nearby nodes will have the data needed
          Chance of finding data depends entirely on how "rare" the data is
    Hybrid
      -Commonly has a central server that helps peers connect with each other
      PROS:
        Known to have far better performance than either other type due to search functions
      CONS:
        Requires some kind of managing server

NOTES
  Since every peer acts as a server and client, they are vulnerable to exploits
  Malware can spread through a system fast without a trusted connection
  P2P networks are very robust due to not having a single point of failure
