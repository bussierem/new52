# Week 26:  Terraform (COMPLETE!)

This week I will be using Terraform to learn how to setup AWS instances and provision
resources from the various AWS services

[Terraform Tutorial](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) (Terraform Docs)

Overall this week was a pretty easy one - the initial learning for Terraform took most,
but not all of the 8h.  I spent the rest of the time testing it out myself with various
AWS instance configurations, mimicking things I had done in my AWS Learning in Week 24.

Unfortunately, I won't be including this work in my git commits for security.
