# Week 14:  CSS Libraries - Sass, Bootstrap, Flexbox (COMPLETE)

This week will be spent learning various CSS libraries and frameworks

The work for this week was captured in my Shadowrun Character creator project.
I learned quite a bit about SASS/SCSS, did more work with Bootstrap and Flexbox
in my project.  I found SASS to be very easy to visualize, and almost immediately
began thinking of CSS in terms of SASS organization and inheritance methods.  I
Will definitely be continuing to use it in my projects.
