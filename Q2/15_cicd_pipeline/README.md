# Week 15:  CI/CD Pipelines - Gitlab, Deployments, etc. (COMPLETE)

This week will be spent learning how CI/CD Pipelines work, and how to setup,
configure, and manage them.

The work for this week again was not captured in this repo - My current job
coincidentally needed to setup a CI/CD pipeline using Gitlab this week, so I took
the chance to integrate that work with this project.

My time was spent learning a lot about setting it up, how to manage multiple
deployment environments, and configuring the build process in Gitlab using a
`gitlab-cy.yml` file.  This was done with the help of multiple people who were
also learning.  In the end we did indeed setup a successful pipeline with 3 dev
environments and numerous pipeline tests and checks and commit hooks.  Overall
it was a great learning experience for me.
