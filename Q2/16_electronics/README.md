# Week 16:  Electronics, Arduino C, Soldering, etc.

This week will be spent learning more about Arduino, Prototyping electronics
projects, and practicing soldering

Some of the work for this week again was not captured in this repo - Soldering
practice is not something that is committable to a repository...
