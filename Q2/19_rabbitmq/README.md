# Week 19:  RabbitMQ (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning about Message Brokers, working through the
tutorials for RabbitMQ and learning the basics.  I will be doing this in Python,
since the intention is to learn new things, and Python will make that easiest.

After going through the tutorials, I realized that a lot of what they do could be
wrapped into similar functions and some generic classes for the options, so I spent
the remainder of my time doing so.

Overall I think RabbitMQ is a very valuable tool in my belt to have, and I will certainly
have use for it in future projects.
