# Week 20:  D Language (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning about the "D" Language, working through the
tutorials and learning the basics.  It will be my first foray back into strongly typed,
lower level languages since my college days with C/C++.

This was a VERY successful week - I would say I put the D Language probably in my top
3 favorite languages I've come across.  I will definitely continue looking at this language
later.
