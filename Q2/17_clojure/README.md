# Week 17:  Clojure (COMPLETE)

This week will be spent learning more about the Clojure language, working through
the tutorials and learning the basics of the language

The week was fairly fruitful, but I don't think I'll be continuing a look into Clojure
for a while - I am not a huge fan of functional languages like this, even if it has
features similar to many I like.
