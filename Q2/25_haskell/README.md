# Week 25:  Haskell (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning the Haskell language by way of http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/

This week will partly be to learn another functional language, but will also be in
preparation of later learning of proper Functional Programming concepts using a language
that I can write quick scripts with (Elm was not going to be good for this, and I was
not much a fan of Clojure).

Overall this week, I found myself enjoying learning Haskell far more than previous attempts.  I think
this was for two reasons:  Firstly, that by learning Elm first (which has extremely
similar syntax to Haskell), I wasn't hung up on format.  Secondly, I switched away from
the unapproachable "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good" tutorial, and moved to something much
more friendly of a tutorial (see link above).  I think that I might look further into Haskell
in the future now thanks to this, and I will definitely use it later in this project
to understand more complex Function Programming topics!
