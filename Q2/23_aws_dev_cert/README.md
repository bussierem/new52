# Week 23:  AWS Associate Developer Certification

This week will be spent starting the Udemy Course for AWS Associate Developer Certification,
located at http://udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate/

This will be one of the few projects continued past a single week, as it will be continued
so I can get my AWS Certification by taking the certification test.  I will continue
other projects in the meantime, _after_ this week.
