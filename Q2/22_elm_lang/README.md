# Week 22:  Elm Language (COMPLETE!)

This week I will be learning the functional-programming web framework language "Elm"

I went through all the tutorials located at http://elm-tutorial.org/en, and found them
quite helpful.  Elm as a language is very interesting, although it has a lot of overhead
for what should be simple apps.  I wonder if I could make one myself later, without all the
tutorial help I got...  I will almost certainly come back to this language later.
