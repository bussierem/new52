# Week 11:  Redux (via React-Redux) (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning how to use Redux to manage app state of a React webapp.

The project is a new Shadowrun 5e Character Sheet and Character Creator webapp.  
The project will not be in this repo - this folder only contains this readme.  
The actual app itself has a codebase located at http://www.github.com/bussierem/chummergen
 because I plan for this to be a longterm side project, and Redux being a new technology
 for it was just a happy coincidence.

The week went well learning it - I still feel very new to it, but I can see that
it has a lot of power.  Tutorials have been tough to follow since they all use FP
syntax due to being short and simple tools - mine requires componentization and therefore
slightly different syntax.  Conversion between syntaxes has been difficult at times.
