# Week 13:  Godot Game Engine (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning the Godot Engine for game programming.

The project in mind is a top-down shooter with waves of enemies coming from the
borders of the window.  Moving, Shooting, possibly a melee attack, and enemy
spawning with player death on contact are my hoped for mechanics.

Conclusion:  The tutorial for a top down dodging game was fantastic, but unfortunately,
that tutorial plus others took the entire 8h, and some preliminary searching yielded
very little in terms of tutorials for other things - mostly random forum posts of
people solving minor issues.  I think it will be worth a look again later when the
community is a bit more filled out.
