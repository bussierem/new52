# Week 12:  Chrome Plugin (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning how to create a Google Chrome plugin.

The project in mind is to convert a table-parsing JS function I use at work
into a plugin that can run on a single button click with a popup option

The project is complete, and was 100% successful!
