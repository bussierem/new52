# Week 4:  Flask Webapp using Python, Swagger API, and Heroku hosting  (COMPLETE!)

As part of a hackathon, Josh Davies and I created a webapp that simulated a D&D battle.  
This Webapp used REACT on the front-end, written by Josh, and Flask on the backend
in order to setuo the REST API.  Additionally, we used Swagger to generate an
API Documentation page, and hosted the app on Heroku with automated deploys linked
to merges into master.
