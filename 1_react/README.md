# Week 1:  React  (COMPLETE!)

This project will be the meta project, wherein I am making a small React webapp
that will function as a personal tracker for the **New 52** project

The hope is to be able to:
* Add new projects each week
* See a progress bar for the minimum 8 hours each week for that project
* Add time to that project to advance the progress bar

The focus of course will be on functionality, not style, in order to keep my
tinkering limited to only new things (i.e. actual React code)
