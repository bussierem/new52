# Week 1:  React App

This project will be the meta project, wherein I am making a small React webapp
that will function as a personal tracker for the **New 52** project

The hope is to be able to:
* Add new projects each week
* See a progress bar for the minimum 8 hours each week for that project
* Add time to that project to advance the progress bar
