# Week 3:  EmberJS Webapp  (COMPLETE!)

This was an attempt to try an alternate web framework for building an app.  The
app I began to create here was a site where you can submit and review literally
 anything you want, and other people can come write reviews as well.  Intended
 to be a humorous site, based on an SMBC web comic strip.

_The project was overall not completed - Ember did not turn out to be a very
 enjoyble experience for me, and so I decided not to continue past the 8 hours
 needed for New52.  I may revisit the app idea later with a different tech stack._
