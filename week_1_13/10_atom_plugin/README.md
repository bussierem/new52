# Week 10:  Atom Plugin (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning how to create a plugin for the Atom Editor.

Provided I get through the tutorial of making one, I will attempt to re-create one
of the python scripts I use for work inside Atom so I can use it without leaving
the editor, and it involves parsing Gherkin Feature Files and generating an
Examples Table at the end of the file from the Scenario contained within.

I made very good progress on this, and was able to get the plugin 90% done this week.
  I hope to continue it further on my own time later to complete it.
