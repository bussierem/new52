# Week 8:  Machine Learning BASICS (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent with my first dive into the basics of Machine Learning.  
This is a completely new topic for me, so I will simply be going through an online
tutorial teaching about the classification of Iris flowers.

The result of this has shown me there is a ton of depth in ML concepts, and will
certainly take far longer than the 8 hours I have been able to devote to it.  The
Iris project was interesting, but what isn't shown by the script contained here is
the large amount of reading  I did about ML during this time as well, all resulting
in me still not really understanding all of this.  I think I might not be a math-minded
person enough to really enjoy ML topics, however.
