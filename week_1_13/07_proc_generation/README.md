# Week 7:  Procedural Generation (COMPLETE!)

As part of a hackathon, Josh Davies and I created a webapp that simulated a D&D battle.
(See Week 4) - This week was spent learning about Procedural Generation, in order to
build custom procedurally generated dungeons for the battles to take place in.

Most of this week was spent in research and reading about procedural generation concepts.
More work will be pursued on this topic later, but I will be moving on to other topics.
