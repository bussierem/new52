# Week 2:  REST APIs  (COMPLETE!)

This project was to learn how to setup my own REST API to serve up data from a
single JSON file using Express JS.  The hope is that I can use this as a possible
project template for future languages, etc.  Eventually I would like to extend
this in future projects to serve up a database of some kind.
