# Week 9:  Rust Language (COMPLETE!)

This week will be spent learning the basics of Rust, followed by a small project
of some kind, provided I have the time/inclination to spare.

So it turns out Rust takes a lot longer than 8h of reading and code to make it
through the tutorial.  The stuff I've learned is interesting, but I didn't make
it to anything like Classes or structures.  Will need to do more investigation
of my own.   Last left off at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-03-slices.html
